## Cover Picture

The cover photo shows Saffiyah Khan, an anti-fascist activist in Britain, calmly facing down an aggressive-looking man from the far-right English Defence League (EDL). The photo, taken at the scene of an EDL protest and counter-demonstration in Birmingham on 8 April 2017, went viral at the time. It reflects the hostility of the far-right to people it perceives as foreign, such as Ms Khan, born in Britain to Bosnian and Pakistani parents, but also the resistance and strength of those who are targeted.
